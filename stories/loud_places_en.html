<p><strong>Loud</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Places</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>“</p>
<p>I go to loud places to search for someone</p>
<p>To be quiet with who will take me home</p>
<p>You go to loud places to find someone who</p>
<p>Will take you higher than I took you</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t I take you to higher places you can&#x27;t reach without me?</p>
<p>I feel music in your eyes</p>
<p>I have never reached such heights”</p>
<p>(Jamie XX)</p>
<p>Do you remember our high school days? Were we going there to find someone to be with when the</p>
<p>music quietens and we have to stand by ourselves? Or to get ourselves afloat on a stream of</p>
<p>euphoria, have a treasure hunt for the mythical eternal ‘now’? Were we searching for the MOMENT,</p>
<p>which Slowdive attempted to capture by sound like a photograph, make it eternal in the floating</p>
<p>sound of distorted guitars? When a person is at peace, completely fulfilled, that they have no idea</p>
<p>what to do next? When Alison laughs away Neil’s worries and tells him, “it’s just fine”. All is just</p>
<p>breath. It was one of the things we were subconsciously looking for, when we were trying to find</p>
<p>ourselves there, don’t you think? To have that photographic as a reminder how life can be fun, as</p>
<p>memory to turn back and gather strength from in our hardest moments.</p>
<p>All these memories of our old group went through my head when I heard that track in radio. My</p>
<p>head almost started spinning. Sentimental gravity of all those places we were going to became</p>
<p>unbearable. I just head quit early and go remembering. Now I’m standing near the backdoor stairs,</p>
<p>where we used to smoke joints together. The chilly October breeze mixes up with the memories.</p>
<p>Horny adolescents standing around, some are smoking. Dance music and sexual tension blending in</p>
<p>the air. And anxiety and confusion. Energy in the process of getting to know itself. And now I’m here</p>
<p>in that whirling world, but just like a tourist, watching it through increasingly impenetrable wall of</p>
<p>time. In real, only orange leaves are quietly dancing with me.</p>
<p>I never really stepped over the doorstep of these loud places by more than one foot. The anxiety</p>
<p>coming with the second step always overpowered me. So I was never really present in the loud</p>
<p>places. I haven’t found anyone to take my hand and take me home. Someone to live with, in quieter</p>
<p>places, be it either a different person or a more content version of myself. I never was the social,</p>
<p>careless Alison. I was always closer to the more solitary Miranda, contemplating all the more</p>
<p>peculiar, dimly lit recesses of life. Alison and Miranda are mythological characters, archetypes,</p>
<p>reflections of different modes of human existence captured into shoegaze songs. Rym user mk741</p>
<p>finds Miranda more attractive. But Miranda achieved her Mirandaness by experiencing all she could</p>
<p>as Alison. She grew up. I didn’t, and it left a bleeding emptiness in me. And a person who feels empty</p>
<p>is not the attractive one.</p>
<p>My friends are gone too, in the worlds of almost thirty-somethings. Two jobs, mortgage talks,</p>
<p>washing asses of their kids, all the big adult stuff. They lived in the worlds of loud places, perhaps</p>
<p>found what they were looking for and moved on.</p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>„</p>
<p>So I’m finally kicked outta here“, was my first feeling when I got my final degree few months back.</p>
<p>Family and friends were congratulating me, envisioning my bright future career. For them, it’s a</p>
<p>stable, high paid job they don’t understand, which makes them think it’s fascinating. For me, writing</p>
<p>code for cash registers in luxury shops or some similar pointless bullshit. Sit from eight to five by</p>
<p>computer, in some bland office with some jerkdroid and have no idea what to talk with him about.</p>
<p>Then go home. Tomorrow the same. Pay the rent. Feel the emptiness grow year by year.</p>
<p>No, I’m not going without fight. For once I will choose the hard path, not the delineated future. I</p>
<p>found a job at a bar. I’m here just a month and I still kinda suck at it. But I feel like I’m doing</p>
<p>something with purpose. And also I have to do a side job in music library archives. It’s weird how</p>
<p>doing something meaningful pays you less. Visitors are rare, so I spend most of the time reading</p>
<p>musicians’ biographies.</p>
<p>Too many people walk around here. I wanted to be alone, I can’t dive into myself the same when I</p>
<p>feel others’ gazes on me. Sometimes I feel like they can sense how I do not belong. Like if everything</p>
<p>in our world ran on precisely on the same few predefined tracks. Beep beep, go to work. Beep beep,</p>
<p>go home. Beep beep, watch the news. Beep, beep, company party. Impulsively chasing memories</p>
<p>isn’t a valid program routine. No one told me about doing anything similar. I feel a bit improper then.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>Hi Jul”. I got torn out of lalaland by familiar voice. I turn around and recognise Liam. I spend few</p>
<p>days this summer with him and few other guys. After then I have been trying to process that uneasy</p>
<p>feeling he left in me. Objectively, he was a cool guy. He was pleasant and had similar opinions and</p>
<p>tastes. We could talk mull over nineties rock till aleluja. My problem with him is that I saw myself in</p>
<p>him. Too much. It felt like looking into a mirror and being humiliated with the reflection. When I</p>
<p>thought about him after the trip, I had to feel all the moments I stood alone in the corner and my</p>
<p>eyes reflected all the fun-having attractive people. The life I wanted and envied. A commonplace for</p>
<p>them, a pain I never found peace with for me. And it taught me to recognize patterns in behavior of</p>
<p>people who experienced the same. And be repulsed by it.</p>
<p>I know it’s not fair. It’s not logical, it just is that way. Shouldn’t we feel attracted instead? Normal</p>
<p>people want to be understood, right? But I hate my sentimentality, I don’t want it to be understood. I</p>
<p>want to overcome it. I want some cool others to kick me out of the cell of my sloppy, lost-in-past self</p>
<p>and show me how to make the second step. Closeness of people like Liam on the contrary every</p>
<p>elementary time unit reminds me of what I am and don’t want to be. I have always attracted similar</p>
<p>types. Men tend to see this and they surmise they can feel safe with me. That I’m not some alpha</p>
<p>bitch who will laugh at their vulnerability. That I will not judge. That I will understand them. Yes, I can</p>
<p>understand you, but that just makes me worse I believe. I’m sorry, you don’t deserve my cold act, but</p>
<p>I can’t do better. I’m the bad one. I wish I could tell you, but I can’t.</p>
<p>We tossed few words and I apologized that I have to go. The thoughts he provoked overpowered</p>
<p>everything else. I wanted to be alone with my shame. I took my headphones and took a shortcut</p>
<p>through the forest. It was getting darker when I stepped outside of the woods on my favorite spot.</p>
<p>It’s on a hill above the town. You can sit here on a bench and think. It’s like in some movie. The</p>
<p>orange-blue evening sky evokes that specific kind of melancholy, which you could call happiness for</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>deep people if you want to feel pretentious. The kind of melancholy which makes you want to</p>
<p>rethink your entire life and become someone better.</p>
<p>There’s that kind of thought which you find inconceivable at first, but which gradually like some</p>
<p>worm cuts through your subconscious and then suddenly jumps to the surface and makes you an</p>
<p>offer you can’t refuse? That’s what happened here. I will do molly with Liam. The logic is clear. As an</p>
<p>entactogen, it should allow me face those feelings with empathy and closeness instead of repulsion.</p>
<p>To know what it’s like to live freely of the emotional baggage and what’s it like to not hurt those I</p>
<p>should feel close to. That’s how I think it’s used in ptsd therapy.</p>
<p>At home I turned the computer on and googled testimonials from therapy sessions. All what I read</p>
<p>further enforced my decision. This is what I need to do. I haven’t even felt too anxious when I called</p>
<p>him. He said that he has to leave at the end of the week but he agreed. He haven’t even seemed too</p>
<p>surprised. It seemed bizarre but somehow intuitively I believed.</p>
<p>But it’s fucked. Nowadays, drugs are rare and expensive. It’s not easy to find real molly, most crap</p>
<p>being sold is just meth with wrong label on the tin. And I can’t wait, apparently he’s going on the</p>
<p>other side of world for who knows how long. And I had to lend some cash to a friend who would get</p>
<p>evicted with his kid. I couldn’t leave it that way. And I can’t wait for next paycheck. Another wormy</p>
<p>thought? No, that can’t be possible. But I need to make that step. I can’t wait anymore. I must have</p>
<p>waited ten years already to make that second step. Who the fuck knows whether there’s even going</p>
<p>to be another chance. And nobody’s giving me second life. Even when others were fucking me over, I</p>
<p>always tried to play fair. And what did I get? Being a saint doesn’t always pay off. Innocence doesn’t</p>
<p>always make us good. I’m hurting the world by denying it the potential I could give. Only god knows</p>
<p>how much wrong I indirectly caused by my cowardice. We should rise up against the system, the one</p>
<p>in which a guy working two jobs doesn’t have enough money to pay the bills. The system that is</p>
<p>tearing us against each other. Make your step to become a better person and steal. Haha.</p>
<p>Oh my god. She has over a thousand there. She seemed nervous the whole time. She left forgot her</p>
<p>wallet. It was the offer I couldn’t refuse. I thought of one person I saw earlier in the bar. And I saw</p>
<p>him later in the music archives. He seemed impressed by my Naomi Yang style earring. It’s nice when</p>
<p>people notice. It’s less nice when they don’t return the sheet music I’m supposed to not let anyone</p>
<p>outside with. I have no idea what problems will that cause me. Did he at least have a good reason?</p>
<p>Anyway I lost my privilege to judge him today. Sigh. It’s worse than I expected. I don’t know whether</p>
<p>my stomach tightens more from the disgust over myself, fear of the cops, fear about what will</p>
<p>happen to that girl or how the tonight‘s meeting goes. But finally I will make the second step. There’s</p>
<p>no going back now. I feel like I’m possessed. The power of the wormy thoughts. Sigh.</p>
<p>We decided to sit in my apartment. It’s beginning. The negativity evaporated. Midnight City by M83</p>
<p>plays from the speakers and we are the children in the video. Standing above the city lights, they are</p>
<p>calling us, “Find your kind”. But we found it now, we’re here for each other. I made the second step,</p>
<p>wherever it goes. My isolation was just my fear. I want to stay here. Make it up for everyone. I hope</p>
<p>the girl is going to be alright. Now I just want to hug her and make it up for her too. Too late for that,</p>
<p>tormenting myself want do her any good. I did what I did, the consequences are here for later. The</p>
<p>only thing I can do is to make the most out of this beautiful energy. It won’t be easy, but I can’t be</p>
<p>total failure anymore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Youtube autoplay switched to a new video. The sound waves shifted to a new energy. Cello and</p>
<p>piano. Dream 13 by Max Richter. The piano melody sounds like the softest silk ever conceived being</p>
<p>draped over my skin and heart. The monitor shows intimate, polaroid like recordings of happy</p>
<p>moments of someone’s childhood. Feeling of peace spreads through my body like warmth from a</p>
<p>heated blanket. My legs suddenly feel like they can’t hold me. I fell on the bed. Lying, I saw the spark</p>
<p>in his eyes. I felt the music in his eyes. And it hit me. I felt his whole life, his life story, which got the</p>
<p>same emotional depth as mine. I of course knew that, but now I FELT that. How can someone who</p>
<p>suffered the same pains repulse me? It felt ridiculous. I wanted to hug him, make him absorb my</p>
<p>sorry, make him feel it’s going to be ok. I have never reached such highs. I feel music in your eyes.</p>
<p>That was the track with which it all began.</p>
